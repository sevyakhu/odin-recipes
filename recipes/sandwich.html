        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p><i>Back to our childhood we go!</i></p>
        <p>Try out this delicious staple of your childhood, elevated to fit your adult tastebuds.</p>
        <p>Chessy goodness stuffed in between freshly toasted bread.</p>
        <p><strong><i>Yum!</i></strong></p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Texas toast: 8 slices</li>
            <li>Unsalted butter: 4 tbsp</li>
            <li>Medium cheddar cheese: 4 slices</li>
            <li>Gouda cheese: 4 slices</li>
            <li>Havarti cheese: 4 slices</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Spread 1/2 Tbsp of butter on one side of each slice of bread.</li>
            <li>Set a skillet over medium/low heat and place 2 slices
                of bread in the skillet with the butter-side-down.</li>
            <li>Stack cheeses on one piece of toast: cheddar, havarti, then gouda.
                Once the breads are golden brown, closed the sandwich with
                the crisp sides on the outside.</li>
            <li>Continue cooking until the bread is a rich golden brown, flipping once</p>
                and press down lightly to help the bread stick to the cheese.</p>
                Total cooking time should one 5-6 minutes. Keep the heat</P>
                on medium low for the breads to toast slowly, giving your cheese a chance to</p>
                fully melt and adhere to the bread.</p></li>
            <li>Once you see the cheese has melted and breads are browned, remove
                to a plate and cut in half diagonally to serve. Repeat with the next sandwich.</li>
        </ol>
