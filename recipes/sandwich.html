    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Texas toast: 8 slices</li>

        <li><p>Set a skillet over medium/low heat and place 2 slices</p>
            <p>of bread in the skillet with the butter-side-down.</p></li>
        <li><p>Stack cheeses on one piece of toast: cheddar, havarti, then gouda.</p>
            <p>Once the breads are golden brown, closed the sandwich with</p>
            <p>the crisp sides on the outside.</p></li>
        <li><p>Continue cooking until the bread is a rich golden brown, flipping once</p>
